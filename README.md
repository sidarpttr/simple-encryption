# Simple C Encryption Program

This C program encrypts a text file using a basic substitution cipher. It shifts each uppercase letter by a fixed key (12 in this case) and writes the encrypted text to a new file.

## How to Use:
1. Put the text you want to encrypt in "read.txt."
2. Run the program.
3. Find the encrypted text in "write.txt."

Note: This is a straightforward example for educational purposes and is not suitable for secure applications.
